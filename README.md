This package is used to check if all the keys are available across all the .env files.
This package is useful when you have multiple .env files,
and you want to make sure that all the keys are available across all the .env files.

With a team of developers, it is possible that some developers might forget to add the keys they used in their .env file
to the .env.example file or the other way around.

## Features

- Check if all the keys are available across all the .env files.
- Add the missing keys to the .env files automatically (configurable) considering the line numbers and empty lines.
- Check if the .env and other provided files are present in .gitignore, so that they are not committed to git by
  mistake.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require msamgan/laravel-env-keys-checker --dev
```

To configure this package, you can add environment variables to your `.env` files. See
the [config file](config/env-keys-checker.php) for details. Please make sure that you refresh the config cache after
adding/updating the environment variables. ``php artisan config:cache``

```bash

If you prefer, you can also publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="env-keys-checker-config"
```

## Usage

### To check if all the keys are available across all the .env files.

```bash
php artisan env:keys-check
```

### To check if the .env and other provided files are present in .gitignore.

```bash
php artisan env:in-git-ignore
```

## In Test

You can also use this package in your test cases to make sure the required feature is working as expected.

### To check if all the keys are available across all the .env files.

Add the following code to your test case.

Make sure to add ``--auto-add=none`` to override the default configuration.

```php
it('tests that the .env key are same across all .env files.', function () {
    $this->artisan('env:keys-check --auto-add=none')->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

### To check if the .env and other provided files are present in .gitignore.

Add the following code to your test case.

```php
it('tests that the .env and other provided files are present in .gitignore.', function () {
    $this->artisan('env:in-git-ignore')->assertExitCode(0);
});
```

## Configuration
